  abstract = {The population growth and harsh weather conditions in Saudi Arabia increase the demand for electricity due to the overwhelming usage of air-conditioning system for cooling during the excessively hot weather summer conditions. Therefore, the demand to produce efficient insulation materials for building construction has recently increased for energy and environment conservation, particularly with the recent increase in the electricity tariffs. In this paper, finite element analysis using ABAQUS software was used to determine the optimum geometry of holes for concrete bricks that would increase the thermal resistance of the wall, thereby reducing the consumption of electrical power. The analysis was carried out for 23 models with different configurations of holes for masonry concrete bricks. Regular and staggered cavities arrangements were analyzed. The conduction, convection and thermal radiation phenomena were considered for solid and hollow masonry bricks. The results demonstrated that 51\% hollow ratio could reduce the average inner surface temperature \$\$(T\_\textbackslash mathrm\{i\})\$\$of the concrete brick by \$\$7.18\textbackslash,\{\^\{\textbackslash circ \}\}\textbackslash hbox \{C\}\$\$. For bricks with the same hollow ratio, it was observed that there is an effect of the shape of holes in reducing the thermal flow through the bricks, while the number of holes has a marginal effect on the average inner surface temperature \$\$(T\_\textbackslash mathrm\{i\})\$\$. Further, the staggered arrangement for circular holes has considerable effect in reducing \$\$T\_\textbackslash mathrm\{i\}\$\$for bricks with four cavities, while the rectangular cavities have negative impact on \$\$T\_\textbackslash mathrm\{i\}\$\$. Moreover, for the models with circular and rectangular eight cavities, the staggered arrangement has an advantage in reducing \$\$(T\_\textbackslash mathrm\{i\})\$\$.},

These high power and high frequency devices have been experiencing a paradigm shift toward designs that favor extreme integration and compaction. The reduction in form factor amplifies the intensity of the thermal loads and imposes extreme requirements on the thermal management architecture for reliable operation. In this perspective, we introduce the opportunities and challenges enabled by rationally integrating nanomaterials along the entire thermal resistance chain, beginning at the high heat flux source up to the system-level heat rejection. Using gallium nitride radio frequency devices as a case study, we employ a combination of viewpoints comprised of original research, academic literature, and industry adoption of emerging nanotechnologies being used to construct advanced thermal management architectures. We consider the benefits and challenges for nanomaterials along the entire thermal pathway from synthetic diamond and on-chip microfluidics at the heat source to vertically-aligned copper nanowires and nanoporous media along the heat rejection pathway. We then propose a vision for a materials-by-design approach to the rational engineering of complex nanostructures to achieve tunable property combinations on demand. These strategies offer a snapshot of the opportunities enabled by the rational design of nanomaterials to mitigate thermal constraints and approach the limits of performance in complex aerospace electronics.},

Our laboratory has introduced the concept of a thermal resonance device for this purpose, with potential to power wireless sensor networks (WSNs), devices embedded into structural elements, and electronics deployed in relatively inaccessible areas. This approach has particular advantages for the desert environment, where conventional energy harvesting devices are severely confounded by frequent sandstorms, extreme temperature and high solar fluence. Herein, we design, fabricate, and test a thermal resonator for the conversion of diurnal temperature fluctuations to electrical power in a harsh desert environment using a thermally conductive phase change composite as a high thermal effusivity material, specifically tuned to the temperature fluctuating environment of Thuwal, Saudi Arabia (22.3095\textdegree N, 39.1047\textdegree E). The composite consists of a highly porous and thermally conductive nickel foam impregnated with eicosane as a phase change material for enhanced thermal capacity. The high thermal effusivity material is incorporated into a rationally-designed thermal resonance device, which is tested for a period of two weeks in Saudi Arabia, extracting as high as 2\,mW from approximately 10\,\textdegree C diurnal temperature fluctuations. These experimental data provide a test of the theoretical model for the design and operation of the device. Overall, these results highlight the opportunity of employing thermal resonance devices for energy harvesting, particularly in the desert environment.},

Herein, a low colored and transparent shape memory copolyimide (SMcoPI) is obtained by suppressing the charge transfer complex interactions. The optical transmittance of the synthesized SMcoPI film could reach at {$\sim$}86\% at the wavelength of 450\,nm, far higher than the nearly zero optical transmittance of yellow and brown Kapton H. The better optical transparency could be attributed to the loose molecular chain arrangements induced by the meta-substituted groups and flexible ether linkages. The glass transition temperature (Tg) range of the synthesized SMcoPI films is from 179\,\textdegree C to 220\,\textdegree C, which is higher than that of reported optically transparent SMPs. The effective decomposition temperature at the weight loss of 5\,wt\% is 517\,\textdegree C, showing excellent thermal stability. The SMcoPI also demonstrated good shape memory behaviors with high shape recovery ratio (Rr, {$>$}96\%) and shape fixity ratio (Rf, {$>$}97\%). In addition, the SMcoPI could maintain high optical transmittance, good thermostability and excellent shape memory behaviors after the ground-stimulated space thermal cycling test for 250\,h.

By transforming Fourier's law for the heat flux and the diffusion equation for the temperature into equations with constant coefficients, it is shown that: (i) the rectification effect is generated by the simultaneous wavelike modulation of both thermal properties, such that it disappears in the absence of either of them, and (ii) the rectification factor can be optimized and tuned by means of the speed and phase difference of the variations of the heat capacity and thermal conductivity. High rectification factors, greater than 86\%, are obtained for lower frequencies driving the propagation of thermal waves. The proposed thermal-wave diode is thus analogous to its electronic counterpart operating with modulated electrical currents and can open a vista for developing different types of thermal-wave logic components.},

Application of Phase Change Material (PCM) is among the different approaches proposed and analyzed to achieve high thermal rectification. However, these studies often limit the analysis to conduction heat transfer and neglect advection. In the present study, the influence of natural convection on conventional single PCM-based thermal diodes' thermal rectification has been analyzed. Natural convection enhances heat transfer in the inverse direction of gravity, augmenting thermal rectification of diodes with preferential flow in the opposite direction of gravity, whereas adversely affecting the performance of thermal diodes with preferential heat flow in the direction of gravity. Therefore, the design of thermal diode with preferential flow in gravity direction is modified to limit natural convection via the use of metal foam and baffles. The non-phase change material in a thermal diode with preferential flow in the direction inverse to the gravity is replaced with phase change material augmenting the natural convection because of the increase in length. The modified designs led to a mean thermal rectification enhancement of approximately 85\% and 1275\% in thermal diodes with preferential towards gravity and inverse to the gravity directions, respectively. A thermal rectification of more than 50 is achieved in a modified thermal rectifier for preferential flow in the direction inverse to the gravity.},

As a one-atom-thick membrane, graphene has attracted much attention for realizing thermal rectification as shown by many molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we experimentally demonstrate thermal rectification in various asymmetric monolayer graphene nanostructures. A large thermal rectification factor of 26\% is achieved in a defect-engineered monolayer graphene with nanopores on one side. A thermal rectification factor of 10\% is achieved in a pristine monolayer graphene with nanoparticles deposited on one side or with a tapered width. The results indicate that the monolayer graphene has great potential to be used for designing high-performance thermal rectifiers for heat flow control and energy harvesting.},

  abstract = {Thermal management is an essential aspect of various applications, especially in the area of electronic miniaturization. Thermal diodes, which exhibit asymmetric heat transfer characteristics along an axial direction, are one of the vital components for use in thermal management systems. This review summarizes both theoretical and experimental studies of various types of thermal diodes introduced in recent years. The thermal diodes discussed in this review are classified based on their primary heat transfer mechanisms and the materials from which they are constructed. After gaining an understanding of the thermal rectification mechanisms of these thermal diodes, we also discuss several applications of thermal diodes, including solar power systems, caloric refrigeration systems, and thermal computing. Lastly, we present the application potential of the thermal diodes in several thermal systems that have not been investigated before, such as temperature controllers, micro-electronic cooling, space technologies, atomic clocks, and bio-technologies.},

It is found that thermal rectification changes sign when the external homogeneous magnetic field is varied. This reversal also occurs when the magnetic field becomes inhomogeneous. Moreover, we can tune the reversal of rectification by temperatures of the heat baths, the anisotropy, and size of the spin chains.},

  abstract = {Active heat flow control is essential for broad applications of heating, cooling, and energy conversion. Like electronic devices developed for the control of electric power, it is very desirable to develop advanced all-thermal solid-state devices that actively control heat flow without consuming other forms of energy. Here we demonstrate temperature-gated thermal rectification using vanadium dioxide beams in which the environmental temperature actively modulates asymmetric heat flow. In this three terminal device, there are two switchable states, which can be regulated by global heating. In the ``Rectifier'' state, we observe up to 28\% thermal rectification. In the ``Resistor'' state, the thermal rectification is significantly suppressed ({$<$}1\%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of solid-state active-thermal devices with a large rectification in the Rectifier state. This temperature-gated rectifier can have substantial implications ranging from autonomous thermal management of heating and cooling systems to efficient thermal energy conversion and storage.},
